# Object Oriented Programming Assignment

Use the skeleton to implement a Fraction type (in the file `fraction.py`) containing two integers: `numerator` and `denominator`.
The file `test_fraction.py` can be edited and used to test the created class.

1. Add a member function to give a print representation for the class, e.g., `print Fraction(1, 2)` should yield in something like: `1/2`.

2. Add a member function to add to fractions, e.g., `print Fraction(1, 2) + Fraction(2, 3)` should yield `7/6`.

3. Add a member function to invert a fraction, e.g., `print Fraction(1, 2).invert()` should yield `2/1`.

4. Add a member function to give a decimal representation of a fraction, e.g., `print Fraction(1, 2).to_float()` should yield `0.5`.

5. Add a member function that returns the *integer part* of a fraction, e.g., `Fracion(7, 6).integer()` should yield `1`.

6. Add member functions to subtract, multiply and divide fractions. Hint: can we reuse any of the member functions?

7. Add a member function to simplify a fraction, e.g., `print Fraction(2, 6).simplify()` should yield `1/3`.
  Hint: use a function to calculate the greatest common divisor.

8. Can we improve our arithmetic functions with our newly created simplification method?

9. Add some comparison operators, e.g., `==` and `<`.

10. How would you deal with negative fractions?

11. Can you add integer multiplication functionality, e.g., `print Fraction(1, 2) * 2` should yield `2/2`. What about *commutativity*?

12. How can we prevent things like: `Fraction(0.4, 0.2)`?
